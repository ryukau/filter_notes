# LambertW (Header Only Version)
`LambertW.hpp` is obtained from [issue #5](https://github.com/DarkoVeberic/LambertW/issues/5) of [the original repository](https://github.com/DarkoVeberic/LambertW).

## Usage
```c++
double utl::LambertW(const int branch, const double x);       // Main implementaion.
double Fukushima::LambertW(const int branch, const double x); // Reference implementation.
```

- `x > -1 / e` for branch 0.
- `x > -1 / e && x < 0` for branch -1.
- Returns `std::numeric_limits<double>::quiet_NaN()` if `branch` is not 0 or -1.
- `Fukushima` implementaion calls `std::cerr` in case of numeric error.
- `Fukushima` implementation is supporsed to be slower.
